## 📚 Overview

This mini-project introduces the concept of **pointers** in C++. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Understanding pointers is essential for memory management, dynamic allocation, and efficient programming in C++.

The uploaded programs demonstrate the basic functionality of pointers including:
- Storing addresses
- Dereferencing pointers
- Printing values and addresses

## 🧠 Theory

### 🔸 What is a Pointer?
A **pointer** in C++ is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. It allows for indirect manipulation of data and memory.

**Declaration Syntax:**
```cpp
int *ptr;   // pointer to int
ptr = &x;   // ptr stores the address of x
```

**Key Operations:**
- `&` operator → gives the address of a variable
- `*` operator → dereferences the pointer to get the value

## 📂 Program Summary & Algorithm

### 🔹 Program 9a and 9b: Basic Pointer Demonstration
**🎯 Objective**: Demonstrate how pointers store addresses and access values.

**📌 Algorithm**:
1. Declare an integer variable and assign it a value.
2. Declare a pointer and assign it the address of the variable.
3. Print:
   - Value of the variable
   - Value using pointer dereferencing
   - Address stored in the pointer
   - Actual address of the variable

**🧾 Output Example**:
```
10
10
0x61ff08
0x61ff08
```

## 🎓 Conclusion (From a Student's Perspective)

Learning about pointers was eye-opening as it revealed how C++ interacts with memory at a low level. Understanding the concepts of referencing and dereferencing clarified many abstract concepts and made debugging easier. This foundational knowledge will definitely help in advanced topics like dynamic memory, arrays, and data structures.
